## 1. Structs

Structs are used in C# to resemble Value-Types. Their Use-Cases usually involve some Mathematical Context or some Performance-Optimization reasons.

Structs are similar to classes:

```cs
public struct Unit {
  public string name;
  private int maxHealth;
  public int Health {get; set;}
  
  
  public void SetMaxHealth(int value) {
    this.maxHealth = value;
  }
}
```

They cannot inherit from other classes, but they can implement Interfaces.
- (Detail: It is often not recommended, as casting structs to interfaces leads to boxing.)
```cs
public interface IUnit {
  public int Health {get;}
}
public struct Unit : IUnit {
  public int Health {get; private set;}
}
```

They have limitations on their Constructors:

- You can not define a parameterless constructor.
- Your constructors must assign a value to all Fields and Auto-Properties.

```cs
public struct Unit {
  public string name;
  public int Health {get; set;}
  public string Name { set => this.name = value; }
  
  public Unit(string name) {
    this.name = name; // Assign a value to the field
    this.Health = 100; // Assign a value to the Property
    // Name does not need to be assigned, because it is not an Auto-Property
  }
```

Struct Variables and Fields can never be Null!

```cs
public struct Unit {
  public string name;
}

public class Game {
  public Unit unit;
  
  public Game() {
    // This will not throw a NullReferenceException:
    unit.name = "Hey!";
    unit = null;
  }
}
```

Therefore, you cannot assign null or compare a struct variable to null:

```cs
Unit unit;
unit = null; // ERROR: Can not assign `null`
if(unit == null) // ERROR: Operator `==` can not be applied to `Unit` and `null`
```

## 2. Value-Types

We have heard about Value-Types a few times now, but what does being a Value-Type Mean, really?

### Call-by-value

It means, that when invoking Methods, or assigning a value to a variable, the value gets copied.

```cs
public struct unit {
  public string name;
}
```

```cs

void Main() {
  Unit vampire = new Unit();
  vampire.name = "Vampire";
  
  // When passing the unit as a method argument, a copy of the unit is created
  // And assigned to the method parameter
  ChangeUnitName(vampire);
  Console.WriteLine(vampire.name); // OUTPUT: Vampire
}

void ChangeUnitName(Unit unit) {
  Console.WriteLine(unit.name); // OUTPUT: Vampire
  unit.name = "Zombie";
  Console.WriteLine(unit.name); // OUTPUT: Zombie
}
```

Output:
```
Vampire
Zombie
Vampire
```

Here, the following happens:

Code-Line Executed | Variables
-------------------------------
Unit vampire = new Unit(); | vampire:Unit{name:null}
vampire.name = "Vampire"; | vampire:Unit{name:Vampire}
ChangeUnitName(vampire); | vampire:Unit{name:Vampire}, unit:Unit{name:Vampire}
Console.WriteLine(unit.name); | vampire:Unit{name:Vampire}, unit:Unit{name:Vampire}
unit.name = "Zombie"; | vampire:Unit{name:Vampire}, unit:Unit{name:Zombie}
Console.WriteLine(unit.name); | vampire:Unit{name:Vampire}, unit:Unit{name:Vampire}
{{ChangeUnitName end}} | vampire:Unit{name:Vampire}
Console.WriteLine(vampire.name); | vampire:Unit{name:Vampire}

The same goes for variables:

```cs
Unit unit = new Unit();
unit.name = "Vampire";
Console.WriteLine(unit.name); // Vampire
Unit unit2 = unit;
Console.WriteLine(unit2.name); // Vampire
unit2.name = "Zombie";
Console.WriteLine(unit.name); // Vampire
Console.WriteLine(unit2.name); // Zombie
```

### Overview of Value-Types

Value-Types
- Numeric Types `int`, `double`, `float`, ...
- Basic Types `char`, `bool`
- Enum Types e.g. `public Enum WeaponTypes { Gun, Bow }`
- Structs e.g. `public struct Vector2 { public float x, y; }`

### Value Types cannot be null

Again, we cannot assign null to Value-Types, and we cannot compare them to null:

```cs
int a = null; // Not possible
bool b = null; // Nope
```

### Nullable Value Types

You can make value type fields or variables nullable, though, by using the `?` operator.

```cs
public class User {
  public int? age;
}
```

In this example, we assign `null` to the age field, if the user decides, not to give his age.\
This is a more elegant solution, than just assigning `0` or `-1` to his age:

```
User user = new User();
Console.WriteLine("Do you want to name your age?");
if(Console.ReadLine() == "y") {
  Console.WriteLine("What's your age?");
  user.age = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());
} else {
  user.age = null;
}
```

Now, if you want to get the actual value of the field, you need to make sure, that it is not null and then cast it:

```cs
if(user.age != null) {
  Console.WriteLine("Next year, you will be " + (((int)user.age)+1) + " years old.");
}
```

Since this is ugly, C# has a more pretty solution again:

```cs
if(user.age.HasValue) {
  Console.WriteLine("Next year, you will be " + (user.Value + 1) + " years old.");
}
```

## 3. Reference Types

On the opposite side of Value-Types, we have Reference Types. What's the difference?

### Call-by-Reference

Reference Types are passed as references rather than copies to variable assignments and as method arguments.\
Which means, that a reference to the same Unit gets copied.\
The best way of demonstrating this, is by demonstrating the same code as before.\
With only one change: The `Unit` this time is a `class` instead of a `struct`:

```cs
public class unit {
  public string name;
}
```

```cs

void Main() {
  Unit vampire = new Unit();
  vampire.name = "Vampire";
  
  // When passing the unit as a method argument, the unit is passed a reference.
  // Therefore, changes to the unit within that method, will also affect the unit
  // Here, outside the method:
  ChangeUnitName(vampire);
  Console.WriteLine(vampire.name); // OUTPUT: Zombie
}

void ChangeUnitName(Unit unit) {
  Console.WriteLine(unit.name); // OUTPUT: Vampire
  unit.name = "Zombie";
  Console.WriteLine(unit.name); // OUTPUT: Zombie
}
```

Output:
```
Vampire
Zombie
Zombie
```

The same goes for variables:

```cs
Unit unit = new Unit();
unit.name = "Vampire";
Console.WriteLine(unit.name); // Vampire
Unit unit2 = unit;
Console.WriteLine(unit2.name); // Vampire
unit2.name = "Zombie";
Console.WriteLine(unit.name); // Zombie
Console.WriteLine(unit2.name); // Zombie
```

However, the reference still gets copied. But instead of the whole Unit being copied / cloned, only a reference to the Unit is copied.\
We can break it, by assigning a reference to a new Unit to the parameter:

```cs

void Main() {
  Unit vampire = new Unit();
  vampire.name = "Vampire";
  
  // When passing the unit as a method argument, the unit is passed a reference.
  // Therefore, changes to the unit within that method, will also affect the unit
  // Here, outside the method:
  ChangeUnitName(vampire);
  Console.WriteLine(vampire.name); // OUTPUT: Zombie
}

void ChangeUnitName(Unit unit) {
  Console.WriteLine(unit.name); // OUTPUT: Vampire
  unit.name = "Zombie";
  Console.WriteLine(unit.name); // OUTPUT: Zombie
  unit = new Unit();
  unit.name = "Skeleton";
  Console.WriteLine(unit.name); // OUTPUT: Skeleton
}
```

Output:
```
Vampire
Zombie
Skeleton
Zombie
```

You can read above code as:
- A new Unit is created and assigned to a local variable named `vampire`. Let's call that Unit#1
- The Unit, that is referenced in `vampire` (Unit#1), has the `string`-Value "Vampire" assigned to its `name`-Field
- The Method `ChangeUnitName` is invoked, copying the reference that is stored in `vampire` (Unit#1) to the Method's `unit`-Parameter
Within `ChangeUnitName`:
- The Unit, that is referenced in `unit` (Unit#1), has its `name`-Field printed to the Console ("Vampire")
- The Unit, that is referenced in `unit` (Unit#1), has the `string`-Value "Zombie" assigned to its `name`-Field
- The Unit, that is referenced in `unit` (Unit#1), has its `name`-Field printed to the Console ("Zombie")
- A new Unit is created and assigned to the local variable named `unit`. Let's call that Unit#2
- The Unit, that is referenced in `unit` (Unit#2), has the `string`-Value "Skeleton" assigned to its `name`-Field
- The Unit, that is referenced in `unit` (Unit#2), has its `name`-Field printed to the Console ("Skeleton")
Now, we return to the Main-Method:
- The Unit, that is referenced in `vampire` (Unit#1), has its `name`-Field printed to the Console ("Zombie")

And another way of presenting what's happening in the program:

Code-Line Executed | Variables | Objects in Memory
---------------------------------------------------
Unit vampire = new Unit(); | vampire -> Unit#1 | Unit#1{name: null}
vampire.name = "Vampire"; | vampire -> Unit#1 | Unit#1{name: Vampire}
ChangeUnitName(vampire); | vampire -> Unit#1, unit -> Unit#1 | Unit#1{name: Vampire}
Console.WriteLine(unit.name); | vampire -> Unit#1, unit -> Unit#1 | Unit#1{name: Vampire}
unit.name = "Zombie"; | vampire -> Unit#1, unit -> Unit#1 | Unit#1{name: Zombie}
Console.WriteLine(unit.name); | vampire -> Unit#1, unit -> Unit#1 | Unit#1{name: Zombie}
unit = new Unit(); | vampire -> Unit#1, unit -> Unit#2 | Unit#1{name: Zombie}, Unit#2{name: null}
unit.name = "Skeleton"; | vampire -> Unit#1, unit -> Unit#2 | Unit#1{name: Zombie}, Unit#2{name: Skeleton}
Console.WriteLine(unit.name); | vampire -> Unit#1, unit -> Unit#2 | Unit#1{name: Zombie}, Unit#2{name: Skeleton}
{{ChangeUnitName end}} | vampire -> Unit#1 | Unit#1{name: Zombie}
Console.WriteLine(vampire.name); | vampire -> Unit#1 | Unit#1{name: Zombie}


### Overview of Reference-Types

Value-Types
- Basic Types `string`, `object`
- Arrays e.g. `int[] numbers`
- Classes e.g. `public class House { public Color color; }`
- Delegates e.g. `public delegate void HealthDelegate(int newHealth);`

### Reference Types can be null

Reference Types have the default value `null` and can have `null` assigned to them and can therefore also be compared to `null`:

```cs
string name = null;
int[] numbers = null;
```

## 4. Null

`null` is a bit of a Curse in C# and other Languages that have Nullable Types: If you try accessing any value that is `null`, your program will Crash.

```cs
public class Unit {
  public string name;
}
```

```cs
Unit unit = new Unit();
Console.WriteLine(unit.name.Length);
```

Boom, Crash! `System.NullReferenceException` - why?

### Checking for Null

If you are not sure, whether a value is `null`, you should check for `null` first:

```cs
if(unit != null) {
  Attack(unit);
}
```

However, do not start adding `null`-checks everywhere in your code. If you do expect a value to not be `null`, don't just say "If it is null, do nothing." - This will lead to extremely hard to find bugs! Crash Early. Dead Programs Tell no Lies.

```cs
// Very often used, often wrongly:
if(unit == null) {
  return; // Please, only do this, if you really think that it's acceptable, that the Unit is `null`. Don't hide Errors.
}
```

There is a few Handy Operators for Null-Checks:

With the `??`-Operator, you can do null checks and create a new Value, if it is `null`:

```cs
if(unit != null) {
  return unit;
} else {
  return new Unit();
}
```

Translates to:

```cs
return unit ?? new Unit();
```

You can use `??=` very similarly:

```cs
Weapon weapon;
public void Attack() {
  if(weapon == null) {
    weapon = new Hammer();
  }
  weapon.Use();
}
```

Can be reduced to:

```cs
Weapon weapon;
public void Attack() {
  weapon ??= new Hammer();
  weapon.Use();
}
```

And now, to my favorite, the "Elvis-Operator" `?.`:

```cs
if(unit != null) {
  unit.Attack();
}
```

Can be reduced to:

```cs
unit?.Attack();
```

This can be combined in crazy ways, e.g.:

```cs
void UpdateHealthDisplay() {
  Player player = FindObjectOfType<Player>();
  int health;
  if(player != null) {
    health = player.health;
  } else {
    health = 0;
  }
}
```

Can be reduced to:

```cs
void UpdateHealthDisplay() {
  Player player = FindObjectOfType<Player>();
  int health = player?.health ?? 0;
}
```
